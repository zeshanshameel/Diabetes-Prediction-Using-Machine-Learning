# Diabetes-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
 A Python based Machine Learning based program to check whether a person is likely to have diabetes or not.
 
Context:
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. It is provided courtesy of the Pima Indians Diabetes Database and is available on Kaggle.It consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables include the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on. The dataset has 9 columns as shown below;

Content:
Pregnancies – Number of times pregnant

Glucose – Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test

BloodPressure – Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)

SkinThickness – Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)

Insulin – 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)

BMI – Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)

DiabetesPedigreeFunction – Diabetes pedigree function

Age – Age (years)

Outcome – Class variable (0 or 1) 268 of 768 are 1, the others are 0

Problem Statement
This is a Classification problem,the objective is to predict whether a patient has diabetes or not,so Outcome is target variable to predict and the prediction is done based on the meaning given below.

0 – Absence of Diabetes

1 – Presence of Diabetes
